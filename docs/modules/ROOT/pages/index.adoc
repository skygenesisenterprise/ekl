Pkl -- pronounced _Pickle_ -- is an embeddable configuration language which provides rich support for data templating and validation.
It can be used from the command line, integrated in a build pipeline, or embedded in a program.
Pkl scales from small to large, simple to complex, ad-hoc to repetitive configuration tasks.
